# mlb_2023_projections_project

The goal of this project was to first, aggregate projections from multiple sources to find an average projection of each player. Second, to rank each player based on my specific league scoring system. And third, to identify outliers in the correlation between their actual projected ranking vs. their expected draft position to discover value propositions within the player pool.

You can find the data for this file in the data branch.
